<strong>githubSetConfig(String credentialsID = 'github-oauth-token')</strong>

<p>
    Used for pipeline builds, which may not have a native "GitHub" plugin setup. This gets the GitHub URL, formatted as an HTTPS URL, and registers it as a build property. It also uses the credentials ID to register a new Plugin config.
